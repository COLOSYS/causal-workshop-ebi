# Reactome: Knowledge database of biological pathways

Reactome depicts reactions grouped with causal chains to form pathways. The database is moving to a graphDB (Neo4j) which will facilitate extraction and analysis of data [(link)](http://reactome.org/pages/documentation/developer-guide/graph-database/). This will be useful for better extraction of causality statements from this knowledgebase.
